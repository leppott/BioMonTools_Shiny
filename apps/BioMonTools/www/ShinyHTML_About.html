<p>The BioMonTools Shiny app is a free R-based tool to help prepare and analyze biological data in a standardized way without having to download any software programs to your computer. This Shiny app is linked to the BioMonTools R package, which was developed by Erik W. Leppo from Tetra Tech and is available on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/leppott/BioMonTools" class="uri">https://github.com/leppott/BioMonTools</a>). The table below provides an overview of how the website is structured.</p>
<p>Development of the BioMonTools R tools has been funded by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) as part of a larger project to establish Regional Monitoring Networks (RMNs) for freshwater streams and inland lakes (USEPA 2016, USEPA 2021; lead EPA scientist: Britta Bierwagen). The RMNs are a volunteer, collaborative effort in which entities collect long-term data at targeted sites to detect changes over time.</p>
<p>If you encounter problems with the Shiny app and/or have suggestions on ways to further improve it, please email Erik (<a href="mailto:Erik.Leppo@tetratech.com" class="email">Erik.Leppo@tetratech.com</a>) or post your comments on the BioMonTools GitHub page (<a href="https://github.com/leppott/BioMonTools/discussions" class="uri">https://github.com/leppott/BioMonTools/discussions</a>). This is an open-source, collaborative effort and we welcome your feedback.</p>
<p>If you prefer you run this function using R console instead of the Shiny app.</p>
<p>The R package is available for download on GitHub. Use the green “Code” button.</p>
