STATIONID,text,,Yes,
SAMPLEID,text,,No,"Unique sample identifier (typically comprised of the site name, sample date, and replicate number)."
COLLDATE,date,,Yes,Date on which the sample was collected.
COLLMETH,text,,Yes,
TAXAID,text,,No,Taxonomic identification of organisms in each sample.
N_TAXA,numeric,non-negative real number,No,Number of individuals.
EXCLUDE,text,"TRUE, FALSE",No,"Redundant (non-distinct) taxa should marked ""TRUE"". The R code excludes redundant taxa from richness metric calculations but includes them in the composition (percent individuals) metrics."
NONTARGET,text,"TRUE, FALSE",No,"Non-target taxa should be marked ""TRUE"". The R code excludes non-target taxa from all metric calculations."

FFG,text,"CG, CF, PR, SC, SH, MH, OM, PA, PH, XY",Yes,"Primary Functional Feeding Group. Multiple entries are allowed and should be separated with a comma. Entries: collector-gatherer (CG), collector-filterer (CF), predator (PR), scraper (SC), shredder (SH), macrophyte herbivore (MH), omnivore (OM), parasite (PA), piercer-herbivore (PH), xylophage (XY)."
TOLVAL,numeric,number ranging from 0-10,Yes,Taxa with tolerance values ranging from 0 to 3 are considered 'intolerant' to anthropogenic disturbance and are included in the 'intolerant' metric calculations. Those with values ranging from 7 to 10 are included in the 'tolerant' metrics.
LIFE_CYCLE,text,"uni, semi, multi",Yes,"Number of broods or generations of an organism in a year (also referred to as 'voltinism'): univoltine (UNI), semivoltine (SEMI), or multivoltine (MULTI)."
HABIT,text,"BU, CB, CN, SP, SW",Yes,"Habit. Multiple entries are allowed and should be separated with a comma. Entries: burrowers (BU), climbers (CB), clingers (CN), sprawlers (SP), swimmers (SW)."
THERMAL_INDICATOR,text,"corec, cold, cool, warm, eurythermal",Yes,Thermal preference (based on central tendency). corec = core cold.
NOTEWORTHY,text,"TRUE, FALSE",Yes,Noteworthy taxa occur most often at sites with complex and resilient habitat structure that supports high overall freshwater biodiversity. Most of these taxa are rarely or occasionally encountered in benthic macroinvertebrate biomonitoring samples.
LONGLIVED,text,"TRUE, FALSE",Yes,"These invertebrates require more than one year to complete their life cycles; thus, they are exposed to all the human activities that influence the stream throughout one or more years. If the stream is dry part of the year or subject to flooding, these animals may disappear. Loss of long-lived taxa may also indicate an on-going problem that repeatedly interrupts their life cycles"
BCG_ATTR,text,"1, 1i, 1m, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5i, 5m, 5t, 6",Yes,Biological Condition Gradient (BCG) attribute assignments
